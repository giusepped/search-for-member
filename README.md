# Project Name

This is a very basic Rails app that lets you search for members of both houses of Parliament using a keyword that represents one of their interests (e.g. "Housing", "Yorkshire", "Africa" etc). Once you get a list of members back, you can click on each one of them to get a bio page of that particular member

## Usage

```bash
$ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default
$ docker-compose up
```

## Testing

```bash
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose run web rake spec
$ docker-compose down
```
